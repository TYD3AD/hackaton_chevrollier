     * The desired physical devices your camera device should have.
     *
     * Many modern phones have multiple Camera devices on one side and can combine those physical camera devices to one logical camera device.
     * For example, the iPhone 11 has two physical camera devices, the `ultra-wide-angle-camera` ("fish-eye") and the normal `wide-angle-camera`. You can either use one of those devices individually, or use a combined logical camera device which can smoothly switch over between the two physical cameras depending on the current `zoom` level.
     * When the user is at 0.5x-1x zoom, the `ultra-wide-angle-camera` can be used to offer a fish-eye zoom-out effect, and anything above 1x will smoothly switch over to the `wide-angle-camera`.
     *
     * **Note:** Devices with less phyiscal devices (`['wide-angle-camera']`) are usually faster to start-up than more complex
     * devices (`['ultra-wide-angle-camera', 'wide-angle-camera', 'telephoto-camera']`), but don't offer zoom switch-over capabilities.
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * // This device is simpler, so it starts up faster.
     * getCameraDevice({ physicalDevices: ['wide-angle-camera'] })
     * // This device is more complex, so it starts up slower, but you can switch between devices on 0.5x, 1x and 2x zoom.
     * getCameraDevice({ physicalDevices: ['ultra-wide-angle-camera', 'wide-angle-camera', 'telephoto-camera'] })
     * ```
